# Maze-Solver-Library-Project
Maze Solver Library Project - A project to develop different maze solving algorithms in C++ language and simulation environment using third party simulators and custom coded source files. This project is initially planned to be 5 stage project.

## Stage 01:
  - Develop a Repo with submodules for all the component of a fully functional Maze solver using third party simulator like mms-simulator.
  - Create Custom written source files for Algorithms like DFS, BFS, A*, RRT and hybrid variants.
  
## Stage 02: 
  - To compile each submodules into libraries - both static and dynamic libraries so that anyone who is working on their own path palling  projects can import the libraries they are missing from this repo and use it to build their own. E.g, Someone working on a Simulator software may need a library to incorporate lot of path planning algorithms to test their simulator or test the robot they are building.

## Stage 03:
  - With all the submodules and libraries developed and reached saturation point, develop a UI to host all the submodules and Libraries.
  - Create a Simulator using openCV or anyother library as needed.
  
## Stage 04:
  - After Custom writing all the environment components  comiple them into a executable software with an option to load default libraries or use custom components and a option to build and run this project.
 
## Stage 05: 
  - Stage 05 is an endless phase where this repo will be update continueously based on new knowledge accquired as time pass by.
  
# Motivation:
  - To build a educational as well as complete solution software program for Robotics enthusiasts to explore and tinker with the path palning solutions.
